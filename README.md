# Recursive Identity Architecture — Research Notes Series  
### Systems of thought, recursion, alignment, and cognitive architecture.

This repository curates the **public-facing research notes, essays, and lightweight prototypes** that surround my ongoing work on the Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA).  

RIA is my independent framework for reasoning, authorship integrity, and non-collapsing decision structures in complex, uncertain systems.  
This repo does **not** contain the internal architecture itself — only the conceptual layer around it.

## 🧠 What is RIA? *(Public-Safe Summary)*

**Recursive Identity Architecture (RIA)** is my independently developed system for  
**holding contradiction, preserving coherence, and maintaining authorship under uncertainty.**

It emerged from building structured loop-based reasoning with AI systems while preserving:

- internal truth stability  
- authorship boundaries  
- non-collapsing logic  
- traceable decision paths  

RIA formalizes how systems (human or artificial) can:

- hold multiple truths without forced collapse  
- preserve identity and intent under pressure  
- operate through iterative recursion: **branch → test → merge**  
- maintain coherence across contexts  
- generate decisions that remain stable, interpretable, and authored  

> Think of this repo as the **research perimeter** around RIA —  
> the essays, diagrams, and tiny prototypes that explore cognition, truth, and system behavior.  
>  
> *The internal architecture remains private, protected, and unpublished.*

## 🧩 Applied Prototypes (Lightweight + Safe)

These are **small demos** that illustrate ideas adjacent to RIA,  
without exposing internal mechanisms or private logic.

Each project is intentionally minimal — designed to demonstrate concepts like:

- recursion patterns  
- signal drift  
- epistemic stability  
- authorship boundaries  
- event-based reasoning  
- system coherence under uncertainty  

### • Prototype 1: Drift Detector  
A small interactive tool to detect simple semantic drift between two AI outputs.

## 🔐 Scope & Boundaries

This repository is intentionally scoped:

- It includes **public essays**, **diagrams**, and **light prototypes**.  
- It does **not** contain the full RIA specification.  
- It does **not** expose private loops, internal logic, or architecture diagrams.  
- It reflects my independent conceptual research and system design work.  

This repo is the **outer layer** of RIA — the thinking, not the engine.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Series

As AI systems evolve, traditional frameworks for:

- authorship  
- coherence  
- reasoning  
- epistemic alignment  
- introspection  
- and truth-preserving decision making  

are no longer sufficient.

RIA is my ongoing experiment in building a **prototype reasoning core**,  
documented through:

- artifacts  
- loops  
- interfaces  
- research notes  
- system observations  
- cognitive patterns  

This series gathers the public side of that work.

This work was co-developed in dialogue between Rebecca Fenter and an AI assistant. I provided the patterns, questions, and architecture over time. The assistant generated drafts and reframes. I selected, arranged, and take responsibility for the final text and artifacts.
